**Digital Logic Design & Combinational Circuits**

This repository contains a collection of fundamental digital logic circuits, designed and implemented to showcase core concepts in digital electronics. These projects serve as practical exercises for understanding combinational logic, arithmetic circuits, and code conversion techniques.

**About This Repository**

As a student of Electronics and Communication Engineering, this repository documents my work on various digital logic assignments and mini-projects. Each project includes the necessary design files and documentation to explain its function and implementation.

**Projects Included**

This collection features the following combinational logic circuits:

4-Bit Square Circuit

BCD to EXCESS-3 Code Converter

BCD to GRAY CODE Converter

Full-Subtractor

Full-Adder

Project Details
**4-Bit Square Circuit**

A combinational logic circuit designed to compute the square of a 4-bit binary input. The circuit takes a 4-bit number (N) and produces an 8-bit binary output equal to NÂ².

**BCD to EXCESS-3 Code Converter**

This circuit converts a 4-bit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) input into its corresponding 4-bit Excess-3 code output. Excess-3 code is a non-weighted code used in some older computers and for certain arithmetic operations.

**BCD to GRAY CODE Converter**

A code converter that transforms a 4-bit BCD number into its equivalent 4-bit Gray code representation. Gray codes are useful in systems where errors in state changes need to be minimized, as only one bit changes between consecutive values.

**Full-Subtractor**

A fundamental arithmetic circuit that performs subtraction between two bits while also accounting for a borrow from a lower, less significant stage. It produces a difference bit and a borrow-out bit.

**Full-Adder**

The core building block for multi-bit adders. This circuit adds three one-bit binary numbers (two input bits and a carry-in) and outputs a sum and a carry-out.

**Technologies and Tools**

These projects are designed using standard digital logic principles and can be implemented or simulated with various tools, including:

Hardware Description Languages (HDLs): Verilog.

Simulation Software: Vivado.

Logic Families: Implemented using standard logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).
